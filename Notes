python

one of the ways for adding comments in python use the # sign (everything following the sign on that line is a comment)
Variables
eg a = 28     int
b = 1.5       float
c = "Hello!"  str
d = True      bool
e = None      NoneType (this type only has one value N, used for when we want to represent the absence of a value)

f strings (formatted strings)
print (f"Hello, {name}")          instead of using the normal print("Hello, " + name)


conditions
n = input("Number: ")
if n > 0:
  print("n is positive")
elif n < 0:
  print("n is negative")
else:
  print("n is Zero")

  you have to call to be an integer or you'll meet an error of the compiler thinking it's a string
  so the first line would now be
  n = int(input("Number: "))

Sequences
1. string sequence
using the square bracket[] it gives you access to one particular element in the Sequence
example
name = "Harry"
print(name[0])

in programming generally we start counting from item 0

as a string is a sequence of characters the above program will just print out the first letter H

but we could use a different type of sequencing for the index
e.g.
2. Lists sequencing
name = ["Harry", "Hermione", "Ron"]
print(names)
or print(name[0])

3. Tuple
used to store a number of values together that aren't going to change
as opposed to the [] square brackets of the previous sequences tuple uses ()parenthesis
example plotting a graph with two axis x and y
coordinatex = 10.0
coordinatey = 20.0
with tuple we can say
coordinate = (10.0, 20.0)

Data Structures
list - sequence of mutable values
tuple - sequence of immutable values
set - collection of unique values
dict - collection of key-value pairs
