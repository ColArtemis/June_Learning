python

Variables
eg a = 28     int
b = 1.5       float
c = "Hello!"  str
d = True      bool
e = None      NoneType (this type only has one value N, used for when we want to represent the absence of a value)

f strings (formatted strings)
print (f"Hello, {name}")          instead of using the normal print("Hello, " + name)


conditions
n = input("Number: ")
if n > 0:
  print("n is positive")
elif n < 0:
  print("n is negative")
else:
  print("n is Zero")

  you have to call to be an integer or you'll meet an error of the compiler thinking it's a string
  so the first line would now be
  n = int(input("Number: "))
